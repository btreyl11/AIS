Account Information Storage

Written by Brandon Lewis

This program allows the user to type in a series of commands in order to 
trigger various functions:


  'i' =>  INPUT ACCOUNT INFORMATION

    This will cause the program to ask the user for an ID (which should contain
   a string of which is UNIQUE to each account added), a username, and a password
   in that order.

  'o' => OUTPUT ACCOUNT INFORMATION

    The program will prompt the user for the ID(defined above), and then print out
   the desired information from that account.

  'd' => DELETE ACCOUNT INFORMATION

    The program will, again ask the user for the ID of the account, and return true
   if the account is deleted(i.e if it even exists to begin with).

  'h' => TO VIEW THE HELP MENU

    The program will print out the list of commands available for this program (similarly
   to what you see here).

  'a' => OUTPUT ALL ACCOUNT INFORMATION

    Prints all accounts stored.

  'p' => CHANGE YOUR 4-DIGIT PIN

    NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.

  'q' => TO QUIT THE PROGRAM

    Used to exit the program.
